# Image-Classification-on-Brain-MRI

🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
Language: Python 3.11
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📖 Project Overview:

This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify brain MRI scans into two categories:

 - Class 0: Brain with no tumor
 - Class 1: Brain with a visible tumor

Using deep learning and image processing techniques, the model learns to distinguish between healthy and tumorous MRI images.
The workflow includes data preparation, visualization, CNN model design, training with early stopping, and performance evaluation.

🎯 Objectives:

- Load and preprocess MRI images for deep learning.
- Build a CNN architecture capable of binary image classification.
- Apply early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visual predictions.
